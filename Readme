CLient Upload:

	CLient accepts a file from command line argument and uses base-64 encoding and encodes the data and uses json to interact with server by using sockets.
	It establishes a connection along server port and host and sends data along that connection.

Server distributes file to other servers: 
	Each server has a json file called serverList. This contains the port number and host details of other two servers.
	When a server recieves a file from client, a call to allservers method is made. Here we make a call to each server method.
	Using these two method the client file is distributed to other servers.

Server1:
	Has a json file containing details of other servers(Server 2& Server 3).This is used to forward client file to other servers.
	This responds to the price info API calls along with server info API calls

Server2:
	Has a json file containing details of other servers(Server 1 & Server3).This is used to forward client file to other servers.
	This responds to server info API calls



Server3:
	Has a json file containing details of other servers(Server 1 & Server2).This is used to forward client file to other servers.
	This responds to server info API calls
